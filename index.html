                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Roza is a biological reseacher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. Many bacterial species are not well studies and many more remain unknown to science. Roza's role is to discover and document these bacteria. In particular, Roza is interested in bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup to research candidate species. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots. However, Improbable Beff is still searching for the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect tase. Roza has a hypothesis that there's a microorganism that can supply the next best tase and she believes it can be found quite close to home from bacteria found on the human body. Here's what Roza knows so far, the human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria, and different parts of the body harbor different species. Bacteria found in the gut are not the same species that are found on a person's eyelashes, for example. Furthermore, between individuals, the bacterial species may vary even in the same location. Raza hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button, or at least in someone's belly button. To test her hypothesis, Roza has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person's identity is anonymous. They've instead been assigned an ID number. Here's the dashboard that all research participants and fellow researchers can access and select ID numbers to see which bacterial species live in their navels
